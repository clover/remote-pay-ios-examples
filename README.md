# Example Implementation of the Clover SDK for iOS Integration

An example integration of the CloverConnector demonstrating communication between iOS/MacOS and a Clover Mini or Flex.

## Version

Current version: 3.0.3

This example is implemented using v3.0.3 of the CloverConnector SDK, which can be found at [https://github.com/clover/remote-pay-ios/tree/3.0.3](https://github.com/clover/remote-pay-ios/tree/3.0.3).

### Dependencies
* CloverConnector - Provides the communication between the example app and the Clover device.
* ObjectMapper - Provides JSON serialization and deserialization.
* SwiftyJSON - Provides simple JSON parsing.
* Starscream - provides websocket client capabilities.

## Building the example app
* Download and install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
* Install CocoaPods
    * Run `sudo gem install cocoapods`
* Clone/download the [CloverConnector SDK](https://github.com/clover/remote-pay-ios/) into a common folder with [this example source](https://github.com/clover/remote-pay-ios-examples). 
    For example, your <project root> folder should now contain two sibling subfolders, one named `remote-pay-ios` and one named `remote-pay-ios-examples`
    * cd into `<project root>/remote-pay-ios-examples/CloverConnector iOS Example`
    * Run `pod install`
        * This should create a Pods directory populated with the Pods specified in the Podspec
        * It should also create a workspace file that includes the project, plus a pods project
    * Run `pod install` a second time
        * This should update the Pods directory with the installed Pods' dependencies
* Open the `CloverConnector.xcworkspace` file
* Change the Bundle identifier for the CloverConnector > CloverConnector_Example target
* Change the signing Team for the CloverConnector > CloverConnector_Example target
